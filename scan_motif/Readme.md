# peak_motif_scan
tools for motif scan
- We identified different motif pattern in mouse model of Clear Cell Sarcoma. 
Therefore, we developed this tool to detect and quantify the different motif patterns in the EWSR1-ATF1 fusion oncoprotein binding sites on genome

- deeptools_heatmap_motifPeaks.sh is used for visualizing the peaks with a particular motif pattern in terms of protein binding
